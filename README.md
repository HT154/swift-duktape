# CDuktape: Low-level Swift wrapper for Duktape

To see it in action, have a look at [this Universal React+Swift app](https://el-tramo.be/react-swift-example/).

⚠️ This binding currently only contains the functions I need from it, and is still unfinished: some
macros still need to be transformed to proper functions. If you are interested
in using this and missing something, contact [me](https://el-tramo.be).
